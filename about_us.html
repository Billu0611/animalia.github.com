            Animals have feelings too and they also need a home to live. 
            There are many animals living in streets in cold and hot conditions, 
            this needs to be controlled. <br>
            Fortunately many animal shelters are in place where stray, lost, abandoned, 
            mostly dogs and cats, and sometimes sick or wounded are kept and rehabilitated.
            
        </p>
        <p> 
            We have taken an initiative to help all these animals for
            <br> <br>
